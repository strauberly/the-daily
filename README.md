This is where you will see what I am up to on a daily basis for programming and using git. 
Will try to find a way to notate in an organized as it will essentially be a running string of programming solutions that may not make sense when viewed all together.

Please feel free
to utilize and let me know where you find room for improvements so that I can continue to learn and improve. Cheers!

Created a method for accepting a binary string and converting it to decimal for ease of reading for the following challenge.
In class DailyCode called binConv().
### Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:

Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
